        <summary>Unordered Linked List</summary>
        <ul>

        </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Ordered Linked List</summary>
         <ul>
           <li>Case 1: The list is initially empty</li>
           <li>Case 2:  The list is not Empty</li>
           <li>Case 3:  The list is not Empty, and the student CGPA to be inserted is higher than the first node in the list. The node to be inserted somewhere is the list</li>
